# Computational Study on Arrhythmia Risk Post-Myocardial Infarction

This repository contains code and scripts used for the computational evaluation of arrhythmia risk following myocardial infarction, focusing specifically on the role of cellular heterogeneity and electrical conduction through the Purkinje system.

## Repository Structure

- **cellular_models/**: Contains implementations and related scripts for cellular-level simulations.
  - **Paci2020 model**: **IMPORTANT** â€“ The original implementation of the Paci2020 model for human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) **is not included**. Please download it separately from the official source:
    - [Paci2020 Model Download Page](https://www.mcbeng.it/en/downloads/software/paci2020.html)

Ensure you place the downloaded Paci2020 model files within the `cellular_models/` directory before running simulations.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Paci2020 model** from the provided link above.
2. **Place the model files** in the `cellular_model/` folder.
3. Execute simulations using provided scripts according to your analysis needs.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Additional toolboxes as specified within individual scripts
